                <h2>A Legend who reunited whole India</h2>
                <p><b>Chanakya</b> (~300 B.C.), also known as Kautilya or Vishnugupt was an Indian teacher, philosopher, 
                    economist, jurist and royal advisor. Originally a professor of economics and political science at the
                    ancient Takshashila University (an ancient centre of learning located in north-western ancient India, 
                    presently in Pakistan), he managed the first Maurya emperor Chandragupta's rise to power at a young age,
                    and united whole India under the leadership of one king.
                    <br>
                    He authored the ancient Indian political treatise, the Arthashastra. As such, he is considered as the 
                    pioneer of the field of economics and political science in India, and his work is thought of as an 
                    important precursor to classical economics.

                <h3>Biography</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Chanakya was born in a Brahmin family. He was educated at Takshashila, he later became 
                        a teacher (acharya) at the same place. Chanakya's life was connected to two cities: Takshashila
                        and Pataliputra (present-day Patna in Bihar, India). Pataliputra was the capital of the Magadha
                        kingdom. One day Chanakya get to know that 'Alexander the Great' was coming towards India conquering 
                        many regions/kingdoms in between. He went to 'Dhana Nanda', king of Magadha, for help, the most 
                        strongest kingdom of India that time. But there, Chanakya was insulted by Dhana Nanda and there he took 
                        pledge, "until I don't destroy you and put someone worthy on that throne, I will not tie my sacred thread"
                        (not tying sacred thread by Brahmin's was considered a symbol of being on revenge, and withdrawing oneself 
                        from other Brahmin's duties).
                    <li>
                        From here he went on to the search of someone worthy of becoming a king who can protect people 
                        and fulfill the needs of people before his own. After some days he found a boy named 'Chandragupta',
                        who Chanakya thought is worthy of becoming a true king. He take the boy from his family and trained
                        him in Takshashila. Later when the army of Alexander The Great was approaching near border's of India,
                        Chanakya secretly entered Chandragupta into his army and tried to defeat Alexander internally. It is
                        not confirmed but some sources said, its due to Chanakya's well planned actions of defeating Alexander 
                        internally made him sick(poisoned) and later he died due to that, and then their army went back to 
                        Macedonia, which eventually saved India from getting conquered.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        During his life-time he wrote two books: Arthashastra and Neetishastra (also known as 'Chanakya Neeti').
                        The Arthashastra discusses monetary and fiscal policies, welfare, international relations, and war 
                        strategies in detail. The text also outlines the duties of a ruler. Chanakya Neeti is a collection 
                        of aphorisms, said to be selected by Chanakya from the various shastras. These books forms the basis of
                        life and war stretegies which are still valid at present. He never married and served his entire life for
                        the betterment of the people of India. His greatness will surely inspire the generations!
